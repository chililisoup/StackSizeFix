<h1 align="center">Stack Size Fix</h1>

Makes item counts for items with invalid stack sizes visible.

Useful for playing old worlds on newer versions, where you might have "overstacked" items, but since 1.20.5 you haven't been able to see their actual count when they're not in your inventory.

Also useful on any server that sends invalid item stack sizes, like some Hypixel GUIs, for example.

For shulker boxes specifically, [Tweakeroo](https://modrinth.com/mod/tweakeroo) includes a client-side fix, and [Stackable Shulkers Fix](https://modrinth.com/mod/stackable-shulkers-fix) contains a server-side fix. If that's all you're after, and you use one of those mods, then this mod is not needed.
